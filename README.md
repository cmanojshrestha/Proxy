# Proxifier

Proxifier is a program that allows network applications that do not support working through proxy servers to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy or a chain of proxy servers.

With Proxifier you can easily tunnel all TCP connections on the system or the selected ones only.

# Proxifier allows you to:
Run any network applications through a proxy server. No special configuration is required for the software; the entire process is completely transparent.
Access the Internet from a restricted network through a proxy server gateway.
Bypass firewall restrictions.
“Tunnel” the entire system (force all network connections including system connections to work through a proxy server).
Resolve DNS names through a proxy server.
Use flexible Proxification Rules with hostname and application name wildcards.
Secure privacy by hiding your IP address.
Work through a chain of proxy servers using different protocols.
View information on current network activities (connections, hosts, times, bandwidth usage, etc.) in real-time.
Maintain log files and traffic dumps.
Get detailed reports on network errors.
... and much more.
