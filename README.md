# Proxifier

Proxifier is a program that allows network applications that do not support working through proxy servers to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy or a chain of proxy servers.

With Proxifier you can easily tunnel all TCP connections on the system or the selected ones only.

# Proxifier allows you to:
• Run any network applications through a proxy server. 

• No special configuration is required for the software; the entire process is completely transparent.

• Access the Internet from a restricted network through a proxy server gateway.

• Bypass firewall restrictions.

• “Tunnel” the entire system (force all network connections including system connections to work through a proxy server).

• Resolve DNS names through a proxy server.

• Use flexible Proxification Rules with hostname and application name wildcards.

• Secure privacy by hiding your IP address.

• Work through a chain of proxy servers using different protocols.

• View information on current network activities (connections, hosts, times, bandwidth usage, etc.) in real-time.

• Maintain log files and traffic dumps.

• Get detailed reports on network errors.
... and much more.
